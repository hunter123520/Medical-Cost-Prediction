# Highly Accurate Medical Cost Prediction Using Deep Learning MLP-Based Models

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of deep learning MLP-based models for medical cost prediction. This project was presented at the 4th BÄ°LSEL International SUMELA Scientific Research Congress in Trabzon, Turkey.

**Key Features:**

* **Deep Learning:** Advanced techniques for accurate prediction.
* **MLP-Based Models:** Multi-Layer Perceptron for complex pattern recognition.
* **Medical Cost Prediction:** Predicting future healthcare costs.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/hunter123520/Medical-Cost-Prediction]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the notebook:** Open **Medical Cost Prediction.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
